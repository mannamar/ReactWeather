React Weather App  
We created a weather app in React based on our original Figma design that accesses the OpenWeatherAPI for its weather data  

Peer Reviewed by Reed Goodwin: A good looking and well put together weather app. Lacking a functioning favorites but the icons are there and with a little more work could easily be applied. Cohesive and responsive!
